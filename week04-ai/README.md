## Intro

The last decade there's been a lot of buzz around Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning. The explosion in computer performance, especially with GPUs has enabled new possibilities in making computers seem intelligent.

You'll see the terms Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning getting mixed together a lot. They're actually a subset of eachother:

Artificial Intelligence contains Machine Learning, which contains Deep Learning:

Using Machine Learning, you can make a computer do things, without explicitly programming that task. There are roughly 3 types of tasks which can be executed using Machine Learning:

1. Classification: Label data, based on certain inputs. An example would be OCR: given an image of a letter, predicting which letter it is.
2. Regression: Calculating a single value based on a number of inputs. For example: calculating the price of a house, based on data such as number of bedrooms, square meters, neighbourhood, ...
3. Clustering: Group data together. In contrast with Classification, the groups / labels are not known in advance. An example is analyzing customer behaviour (customers also bought...)

Training the algorithm can happen in different ways:

1. Supervised Learning: An algorithm learns, based on example input data with the correct answers. For example: we give the computer a list of housing data with corresponding prices. Or a list of images of letters, with the corresponding letter label. (this is a letter A, this is a letter B, ...)
2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns by itself, based on input data. Used mostly with clustering tasks.
3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm gets a reward when it performs well, and gets punished when it performs badly. Example would be learning to play a game automatically.

## Neural Networks

A Neural Network is built with different layers of "neurons", who are all connected to eachother. Every connection has a "weight", which affects the influence of a given neuron.

![neural network with 2 hidden layers](images/neural-net.jpg)

Image Source: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/

A non-trained network will have random weights and won't give you good results. By training a network with example data, you'll tweak the weights little by little, until our network (hopefully) performs well.

## ML5.js

As a first step, we'll use some existing ML models in our browsers, using the [ML5.js library](https://ml5js.org/).

The ML5 library is built on top of Tensorflow.js - making it a bit easier to use machine learning models in your javascript application.

[Explore the demos in the ML5 reference](https://ml5js.org/reference/) to get a grasp of the capabilities of ML5. Note that the examples are using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) as well, which is a framework for creative coding in javascript. It comes with features to easily setup a a canvas, webcam, load images, draw loop, etc... However, P5 is not a requirement for ML5, you can use ML5 with your vanilla javascript code as well.

There are a few examples available in vanilla javascript as well on [the ml5-examples repo](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/tree/master/javascript).

A lot of the things we're doing in the course, is based on the [Beginners Guide to Machine Learning in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y) from [Daniel Shiffman / The Coding Train ðŸš‚](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). Make sure to watch that particular playlist for a step-by-step, more in-depth explanation of some of the ML5 apps we're building.

### Image Classifier

As a "hello ml5 world" example, we'll try using the Image Classifier. As you can [read on the ml5 imageClassifier docs](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-ImageClassifier/):

> You can use neural networks to recognize the content of images. ml5.imageClassifier() is a method to create an object that classifies an image using a pre-trained model.
>
> It should be noted that the pre-trained model provided by the example below was trained on a database of approximately 15 million images ([ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/)). The ml5 library accesses this model from the cloud. What the algorithm labels an image is entirely dependent on that training data -- what is included, excluded, and how those images are labeled (or mislabeled).

First of all, create an HTML document, and link the ml5 library:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.3.1/dist/ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script>
{
  // our code goes here
}
</script>
```

We'll need to load an image, the easy way to do it, is using a promise based approach with async/await:

```javascript
const loadImage = src=> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.addEventListener("load", () => resolve(img));
    img.addEventListener("error", err => reject(err));
    img.src = src;
  });
};

const init = async () => {
  const img = await loadImage('images/cat.jpg');
  document.body.appendChild(img);
};

init();
```

Nothing new here. Let's go and add the ml5.imageClassifier, to detect what's displayed in the image.

On the [ml5.imageClassfier docs page](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-ImageClassifier/) you'll read that you can create an instance of the imageClassifier, using `ml5.imageClassifier(model)`. Read about the different parameters on that page - especially the part about the optional callback.

We will used the promise based approach, and "await" for the model to be loaded:

```javascript
const classifier = await ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet');
console.log('Mobilenet loaded');
```

Run the app, and check the network panel. You'll notice that there's a bunch of extra network requests, which have to do with loading the model. Once the model is fully loaded, you should see the "Mobilenet loaded" message in your console.

Now the final part: detect the contents of the image. [Read about the classify method and all it's options on the ml5 docs](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-ImageClassifier/) and try implementing it, using the async/await syntax. Show the result on the page, underneath the image:

![classified photo of a cat](images/ml5-classified-photo.jpg)

#### Video Classifier

When you read  [ml5.imageClassfier docs](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-ImageClassifier/) - you stumbled upon the "video" option: you can pass in a video element when creating the imageClassifier, and do image classification on live video.

1. Create a new html document, and load the ml5 library
2. Display your webcam video feed on the page.
3. Create an imageClassifier instance. Store it in a global variable, and pass in a reference to your video element:

```javascript
classifier = await ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', $video);
```

4. Create a separete `loop()` function where you place the `classify()` logic. At the end of that `loop()` function, call `loop()` again, so it keeps classifying:

```javascript
const loop = async () => {
  const results = await classifier.classify($video);
  $label.textContent = `${results[0].label} (Confidence: ${results[0].confidence})`;
  loop();
};
```

Test the app. You'll get mixed results, depending on if the video is showing something in the ImageNet dataset or not. You'll notice a "low" confidence value when classifying something not quite in the dataset (it guesses I am a mask):

![classified me as a mask with low confidence](images/ml5-classified-video-bad.jpg)

But when showing an image of something in the ImageNet dataset, the confidence is higher (and the classification is more correct:

![classified a coffee mug with high confidence](images/ml5-classified-video-good.jpg)

### Transfer Learning

In a next experiment, we'll use "Transfer Learning" to inject our own, custom training samples in the ImageNet model, and get it to recognize "new" classes of images. A live example of the possibilities of Transfer Learning is [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com). Play around with this online app to familiarize yourself of the capabilities of this technique.

[We'll use the ml5 featureExtractor](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-FeatureExtractor/) to apply Transfer Learning in our app.

1. Create a new html document, and load the ml5 library
2. Display your webcam video feed on the page.
3. Initialize the featureExtractor (note that you need to add the .ready property, which contains the promise):

```javascript
featureExtractor = await ml5.featureExtractor('MobileNet').ready;
```

4. ... and create a classifier, passing in a reference to the video tag:

```javascript
classifier = featureExtractor.classification($video);
```

5. Add 3 buttons to the page: a button to classify an image as class "one", a button to classify an image as class "two" and a button to start training. Note that we've specified the classification label as a data attribute `data-label`:

```html
<button id="button1" data-label="one">One</button>
<button id="button2" data-label="two">Two</button>
<button id="trainButton">Train</button>
```

6. Add a click event listener to button1 and button2. The event handler adds a sample to the classifier:

```javascript
const buttonClickHandler = e => {
  const $button = e.currentTarget;
  const label = $button.dataset.label;
  classifier.addImage(label);
};
```

7. Add a click event listener to the training button, in it's event handler you kick off the training process, passing in a progress callback:

```javascript
const trainClickHandler = e => {
  classifier.train(whileTraining);
};

const whileTraining = (loss) => {
  if (loss === null) {
    console.log('Training Complete');
  } else {
    console.log(`Training (loss: ${loss})`);
  }
};
```

8. When training is complete (inside the `whileTraining` function, when loss is equal to null), you can start the same `loop()` logic as in the previous exercise.

Launch the app, and add samples for classification one and classification two. For example: in samples for classification one you are in the frame, and classification two you are outside of the frame. Add at least 15 samples for each scenario, and make sure to move around the frame (when you are in the frame...) to get sufficient different samples. After training, the app should be pretty confident about each scenario.

![classifying between an empty video or a teddybear](images/ml5-transfer-learning-classification.gif)

#### Saving / Loading the model state

Having to retrain the model every time you launch the application isn't really practical. Luckely, you can save the state of the model once it's trained, and load that saved state when the application launches.

Add a button to save the model, and link an event handler to the `click` event:

```javascript
const saveClickHandler = e => {
  classifier.save();
};
```

Once the model is trained, click this save button, which will offer you to download a json file and a weights.bin file.

If you want to use this trained model in your app, it's as simple as calling the `classifier.load` method, passing in the path to the json file. You can do this at startup, right after the classifier is instantiated:

```javascript
await classifier.load('models/hotdog-teddy-classifier/model.json');
```

#### Things to do

Try expanding this application:

- Trigger different sounds, based on the classification
- Replace keyboard input with this classifier to control an arcade game

#### Transfer Learning - Regression

Instead of doing classification, we can also use transfer learning to do regression: calculate a single, numerical value based on an input.

1. Remove the 2 buttons from the page. Instead, you'll add a slider and a button to add a sample:

```html
<input id="slider" type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0.5" step="0.1" />
<button id="labelButton">Label</button>
```

2. Create a regressor instead of a classifier:

```javascript
regressor = mobileNet.regression($video);
```

3. Every time you click the labelButton, you'll add a sample to the regressor. This will tell the regressor to what numerical value the video currently corresponds:

```javascript
const labelClickHandler = e => {
  regressor.addImage(parseFloat($slider.value));
};
```

4. The results structure is a bit different, as we don't have multiple classification labels anymore. Update the `loop()` function to show this value:

```javascript
const results = await regressor.predict($video);
$label.textContent = `${results.value})`;
```

![mapping a video to a linear value](images/ml5-feature-extraction-regression.gif)

Try to expand on this technique:

- Map the position of a rectangle to the value
- Explore [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) and see how you can map a frequency to the regression value

### KNN Classification

K-Nearest-Neighbour classification is a way to label data, based on the "distance" of that data to known, labeled data.

![KNN in 2d space: mapping mouse coordinates to a class](images/knn.gif)

In the GIF above you can see 2-dimensional data (x and y positions) being mapped to known data, based on the Euclidean distance. You can [test a live version of this at the "How to build a Teachable Machine with TensorFlow.js" page](https://observablehq.com/@nsthorat/how-to-build-a-teachable-machine-with-tensorflow-js#-o-0-nearest-neighbors).

Using this technique, we can map K-dimensional data to their nearest neighbors. Us humans have a difficulty understanding more than 3 or 4 dimensions. However, the math to calculate the distance and the logic to map an unknown datapoint to a class remains the same.

The advantage here is that we won't need a separate training step and can classify (image) data in real time. We can tweak the model while it is running.

Our app will be similar to the previous classification app, except we won't have a training step. So, create a basic app, showing your webcam video stream and 2 buttons we'll press to classify the image:

```html
<body>
  <video id="video" autoplay width="320" height="240"></video>
  <h2 id="label">Loading Webcam...</h2>
  <div>
    <button id="button1" data-label="one">One</button>
    <button id="button2" data-label="two">Two</button>
  </div>
</body>
```

We'll even create the same featureExtraction as in the previous app. However, after initializing it, we'll create a KNNClassifier, instead of a featureExtractor.classification:

```javascript
featureExtractor = await ml5.featureExtractor('MobileNet').ready;
// classifier = featureExtractor.classification($video);
knn = ml5.KNNClassifier();
```

Every time we press one of the classification buttons, we'll add the feature data of the current webcam image to the knn classifier. Note that this is not the full RGB data, but a reduced set of image "features" created by the feature extractor.

First of all, it's interesting to see this feature data:

```javascript
// in the button click handler
const logits = featureExtractor.infer($video);
logits.print();
```

You'll see a "Tensor" being logged in your console:

```json
Tensor
     [[0, 0.275391, 1.4118662, ..., 0.0468513, 0.2281258, 0.1108307],]
```

This Tensor is an internal data structure from [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), the framework ml5.js uses internally.

Now, you'll add this Tensor to the classifier:

```javascript
knn.addExample(logits, label);
```

We'll also setup a loop, where you'll be classifying the image continuously:

```javascript
const loop = async () => {
  if (knn.getNumLabels() > 0) {
    const logits = featureExtractor.infer($video);
    const classification = await knn.classify(logits);
    console.log(classification.label);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
};
```

Run the app, and classify your two scenarios. You should be able to add examples while running, and see the model improve in real time.

#### Save - Load KNN

Just like before, you can save the model state and load it again, so you don't need to retrain all of the time:

```javascript
// saving the knn model state
knn.save()
```

```javascript
// loading the knn model state
knn.load('models/ml5-knn-classification-save.json')
```

## RunwayML

[RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) is an application which makes working with Machine Learning models a lot easier for creators. Instead of going through the work of configuring and installing a model on your machine (including all it's dependencies), it runs models in docker containers, locally or in the cloud. You can easely explore a model's capability using an intuitive desktop application, which even provides options to link models together.

Once you've familiarized yourself with a model, you can talk to the RunwayML application using sockets or http requests. This way you can write your own visual layer, which talks to the model through Runway behind the scenes.

Some models only run on the GPU, others support running them on your CPU. At this time, running GPU models locally (on your local docker install) only works on Linux with nvidea GPUs. Fear not if you don't have that configuration: there's also an option to run those models on a cloud GPU. You do need to pay for that usage though, and there's an additional delay communicating with that cloud GPU.

### Face-Landmarks

As a first example, we'll use the Face-Landmarks model.

![preview of face landmarks - detect features on images of faces](images/runway-face-landmarks-tile.jpg)

This model enables you to detect face features (eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, ...). It's possible to run it on your local CPU, so you don't have to spend any cloud credits.

Get the model up and running within the RunwayML interface and explore it's configuration options.

#### HTTP Fetch

RunwayML runs socket and HTTP endpoints, so you can talk to RunwayML from external apps. As a first, quick test, we'll call the HTTP endpoint from Javascript, as most of the code can be copy pasted from within RunwayML ðŸ˜Ž

Create a new HTML file, and add a canvas and a script tag:

```html
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<script>
</script>
```

Store the canvas and a 2d drawing context in a global variable:

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('c');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

Open the Network tab in runway, and select Javascript. At the bottom, you'll see the code to fetch the data of the currently running model:

![Screenshot of code to get model output](images/runway-screenshot-http-output.png)

Copy that fetch code over, and log the points and labels:

```javascript
console.log(points, labels);
```

You should see a list of 72 points and labels in your console. The points are x/y pairs of relative values (values between 0 and 1):

```javascript
[[0.38666666666666666,0.4225],[0.39,0.4875],[0.395,0.55],[0.405,0.615],[0.4216666666666667,0.6725],[0.44666666666666666,0.72],[0.4816666666666667,0.7575],[0.5166666666666667,0.7875],[0.5566666666666666,0.7975],[0.5933333333333334,0.785],[0.6266666666666667,0.7525],[0.655,0.71],[0.6766666666666666,0.66],[0.69,0.6025],[0.6966666666666667,0.54],
// etc...
]
```

Use [`ctx.fillRect(...)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect) to draw squares on the canvas. Make sure to multiply the relative point values by the canvas size to map them to canvas space...

```javascript
point[0] * canvas.width
```

Every time you refresh the page, you should see a simple visualization of the points coming from RunwayML:

![face landmarks on canvas](images/runway-face-landmarks-canvas.png)
